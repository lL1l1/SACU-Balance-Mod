## FAF SACU Rebalance

This is a mod for [Forged Alliance Forever](https://github.com/FAForever/fa).

Implements changes for the SACU rebalance proposed by balance team: cheaper SACUs, stronger adjacency/gateways, new army support enhancements.
Rambo SACUs are independently reworked with new weapons and upgrades to fill gaps in faction rosters.

### General Changes

- Cheaper SACUs: Buildtime and energy costs are significantly reduced across the board.
  - RAS is more energy expensive due to decreased base SACU mass cost. RAS also increases death volatility of SACUs.
  - Weaker base SACUs: Unupgraded SACUs have less HP and/or DPS.
- Stronger gateways: Gateways consume 32-44 mass/s building SACU and have 160 buildpower, while costing 2550 mass, down from 3000.
- Stronger adjacency: Mass fab and pgen adjacency for gateways is un-nerfed and made equivalent to land factory adjacency.
- Engineering upgrade buff: Engineering upgrades are made much cheaper, especially on buildpower and energy, so that they can come close to engineering stations in power.

### Faction specific changes (Rambos and support enhancements)

- UEF SACUs are highly armored with good firepower. They have powerful support enhancements and combat enhancements designed to engage T4 units.

- Cybran SACUs are lightly armoured and slow, but are highly upgradeable with enhancements designed to engage enemy T3, SACU, naval, or air units.

- Aeon SACUs are agile and have a powerful sensor suite (to counter underwater cloak) but are lightly armored. They have cheap combat enhancements designed to engage enemy T3 units.
Aeon SACU nano is removed since nano does not fit the faction.

- Seraphim SACUs are highly armored with increased Regeneration rate but reduced firepower without combat enhancements. They have unique utility/support enhancements and powerful combat enhancements designed to engage enemy T3 units.
